<H1>Background & Objectives</H1>
<p>A homeworker ( gardener, child custody, domestic worker ) is generally paid per hour by the individual employer. It performs from time to time or regular hours and is paid at an hourly rate specified in the contract. The salary is calculated by the week or month depending on the case.</p>
<p>The objective of the application is to provide to home workers a simple and central way to declare online hours worked and to individual employer the way to validate hours worked and to calculate the monthly or weekly salary  (called period).</p>
<p>The principle is to avoid double information on paper (each part note information) with a final check by comparison at the end of the month (with difficulties to remember in case of errors).</p>
<p>The time entry must be quick manner using a smartphone or tablet devices now widely available and connected to the Internet using WiFi widespread in homes. The reminder of the input can be done via email or sms with a link to access the day to grasp.</p>
